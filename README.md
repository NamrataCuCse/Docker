# Docker

##DOCKER RUN
Create a new container based on the image we just created and start it using

a)sudo docker run --name himom -d -p 80:80 mom

#docker run is the equivalent of executing docker create followed by docker start. The -d option tells Docker to run the container detached so to get command prompt back.
